# Hackathons Participated

#### Luxathon 3.0&#x20;

Date: 2021 December 17-19&#x20;

The first hackathon attended by [me](https://github.com/twilighty-abhi)! This was the **first time I was getting to know about the word hackathon**, and all my team members were in the same stage. Another specialty is that I joined college and our classes started on November 21, 2021, so _even before a month spending life as a BTech student_, I was able to form a team and participate and win the special mention award.&#x20;
