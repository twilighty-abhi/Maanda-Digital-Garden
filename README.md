# 🌿 Maanda Garden

<pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>Hai, I'm Abhiram, a student and more. Welcome to my Digital Garden <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">Maanda</a>

### What is Digital Garden?

in short: I think of digital gardens as digital spaces where people grow their ideas from seed to tree: 🌱 -> ☘️ -> 🍀 -> 🌿 -> 🌲 -> 🎄

This Digital garden of mine is a blooming one. To be accurate I've just planted the seeds and watering them; so as of now you won't be finding anything great here, But soon the seeds will grow and many good and great ideas will be blooming here!

> Gardens are farmland that delights the senses; parks are wilderness, tamed for our enjoyment. Large hypertexts and Web sites must often contain both parks and gardens.\
> _-- Mark Bernstein_

Gardens maybe are like gardening people. But watching it with a new eye, it seems to be a crossbreeding of a blog, a Wiki, and a (personal) knowledge management system, with influences of the Zettelkasten note-taking method.

### Why maanda?

This name stuck with me very much and so thus I ended up with this simple name. This name is an unofficial Malayalam word for 'I don't need it'.&#x20;





#### You can now skip to different sections and find what all seeds I've currently planted!
